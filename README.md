# WEB VULNERABILITY SCANNING

## Objective
The web vulnerability scanning lab seeks to desmostrate how OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is installed and used to discover web application security vulnerabilities. The primary focus of the lab was to scan google gruyere web application to discover security flaws and to recommend approiprate remediation. This hands-on lab was designed to enhance my understanding of the OWASP web application security risks.

## Skills Learned
+ Indepth understanding of OWASP top ten web application security risks.
+ Web application security flaws remediation.
+ Enhance knowledge in vulnerability scanning.
+ Development of analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.

## Resources / Tools
+ Windows 10 Pro 22H2 PC with internet access.
+ OWASP ZAP.

## Steps - Part I - Installation

To run OWASP ZAP, it prudent to ensure Java Runtime Environment (JRE). JRE is provide easy installation walkthrough from the launch of the setup wizard ti finish.

## Part II - Vulnerability scanning

Open OWASP ZAP to launch the startup and select "No, I donot want to persist this session at this moment in time".

To scan for vulnerabilities in gruyere web application, copy the Uniform resource Locator (URL) and past it inthe url to attack field.

To access the scanned result, select alert from the information pane. The alert pane dispalys a number of vulnerabilities including Cross-site scripting and SQL injection. These injection security risks third on the OWASP to ten web application security risks just behind Broken Access Control and Cryptographic Failure.

NOTE:
OWASP ZAP uses web crawler to locate other urls connected to the website. It performs non-intrusive scanning (Passive scan) to enumerate the entire website and associated urls building a tree-like structure of websites in the process. this is located in the sites pane.

Each enumerated site can be selected to view the result of the scan of the particular link.

# Conclusion
Staying ahead of cyber criminals is essential in protecting infrastracture from harm. vulnerabilty scanning help detect and remediate security flaws before it is found and exploited by adversary.
